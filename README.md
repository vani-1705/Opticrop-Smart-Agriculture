# 🌾 OptiCrop: Smart Agricultural Production Optimization Engine

## 📌 Project Description

OptiCrop is a machine learning-based agricultural recommendation system that recommends the most suitable crop based on soil and environmental conditions. The system uses important parameters such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), Potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall to predict the best crop for cultivation.

The project combines Machine Learning models with a Flask web application, allowing users to enter agricultural parameters through a simple interface and receive instant crop recommendations. The goal is to improve crop yield, optimize resource utilization, and support sustainable farming practices.
